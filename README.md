# Dynamic Ollama Assistant

**Date**: Saturday, August 16th, 2025   
**Author**: Brittaney Perry-Morgan

An interactive command-line assistant powered by Ollama that dynamically loads and manages a powerful library of prompts from simple CSV files. This tool is designed to streamline your workflow with local large language models by making it easier to select, customize, and interact with a vast collection of pre-built prompts.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **CSV-Based Prompt Library:** Easily manage and extend your prompt library using CSV files. Each file represents a category, making organization simple and scalable.
* **Interactive Menu System:** A user-friendly, paginated menu allows you to navigate through categories, sub-categories, and individual prompts with ease.
* **Dynamic Placeholders:** Prompts can contain placeholders like `[[Your Topic]]` or `<Your Goal>`, which you can fill in interactively before starting a chat session.
* **OCR Integration with Smoldocling:** Populate placeholders by providing a file path to an image or PDF. The tool will automatically extract the text and use it as input.
* **Chat with Ollama:** Seamlessly interact with your chosen local LLM (e.g., Llama 3.1) through the Ollama API.
* **Conversation Logging:** Automatically saves your chat sessions, including the system prompt, to an `output` directory for easy reference.

## ðŸ“‚ CSV File Structure

This script is designed to read prompt data from `.csv` files located in the `/data` directory. To use your own prompts, you must create one or more CSV files that follow a specific structure and naming convention.

### File Naming Convention

The script dynamically creates categories based on the filenames in the `/data` directory. Your files must follow this pattern:

`Mega-Prompts for <CategoryName>.csv`

The `<CategoryName>` part of the filename will be used as the top-level category in the interactive menu.

* **Example:** A file named `Mega-Prompts for Writing.csv` will create a "Writing" category in the menu.

### Column Headers

Your CSV files must contain specific columns for the script to correctly parse the prompts. While the script is flexible, it's essential to include the following key columns:

| Column Header                 | Purpose                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Category`                    | The main category for the prompt (e.g., "Business").                                                                                 |
| `Sub-Category`                | The second-level menu option (e.g., "Business Communications").                                                                      |
| `Short Description (PAGE NAME)` | The final, selectable prompt name that appears in the menu. This should be a concise and clear title for the prompt.               |
| `Mega-Prompt`                 | **This is the most important column.** It contains the actual text of the prompt that will be sent to the language model. You can include placeholders like `[[Your Topic]]` or `<Your Goal>` here. |
| `Description `                | A brief description of what the prompt does. This is included in the system prompt for context.                                      |
| `Tips`                        | Any tips on how to best use the prompt.                                                                                              |
